# Privacy Policy

## 1. Information Collection
- Guild Information: Tanki Croco saves your guild data for the bot to operate effectively, namely: guildID, guildName.
- Game/User information: Tanki Croco does not keep a separate table with all users. The bot saves the user only if he guesses the word correctly and participates in the current game. The bot saves the guild and user IDs to create a new game. When creating a game, the following data is saved: gameId, guildId, channelId, userId.

## 2. Information Usage
- Guild Information: The collected guild IDs are used to link new games and keep guild statistics based on various criteria. This information is not shared or used for any purpose other than improving the functionality of the bot.
- Game/User information: User data associated with games is used solely for the correct operation of the bot and maintaining user statistics. This information is not disclosed or used for any other purpose.

## 3. Data Security
Tanki Croco employs standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We are committed to ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your data.

## 4. Data Retention
- Guild Information: Tanki Croco retains guild IDs as long as the bot is present on the server. To delete this data, you can kick the bot out of the server and the data will be deleted.
- Game/User information: User data associated with games, namely the number of words guessed, is saved forever. If the user wants to delete his data that the bot has collected during this time, he must contact the botâ€™s support server and write about it to the guild owner. Only after this will the user data be deleted forever.

## 5. Third-Party Integration
Tanki Croco does not share your information with third parties. We prioritize your privacy and do not engage in data-sharing practices with external entities.

## 6. Changes to the Privacy Policy
Tanki Croco reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our information practices. Users will be notified of any significant changes through our official communication channels.
