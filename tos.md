# Terms of Service
Welcome to Tanki Croco, a Discord bot that allows you to play the «Crocodile» game with your friends. Before you start using the bot, please read our Terms of Use.

## 1. Acceptance of Conditions
By accessing or using Tanki Croco, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, we advise you to refrain from using the bot.

## 2. User Data Handling
Tanki Croco will collect and store server IDs and its configuration for the bot to operate efficiently. Rest assured, no personal user data is stored until the user begins to guess words and participate in the game.

## 3. Participation in the game
After creating a new game, the user can begin to guess the hidden word. If the user is the first to correctly guess the word, then he becomes the leader and begins to explain the word that the bot sent him. The user's data will be used in statistics on guessed words. The data will not be transferred or used for any other purpose.

## 4. Code of Conduct
Users are required to maintain a respectful environment when interacting with Tanki Croco. Users are expected to guess words honestly without using secondary accounts to boost statistics. You can be in a voice channel and explain words there, but it’s better to do it in a chat. The user is expected to use these features responsibly and in accordance with Discord's Terms of Service. Harassment, hate speech or any form of inappropriate behavior is strictly prohibited. Any misuse, attempts to disable the bot, or other violations may result in Tanki Croco's service being suspended permanently.

## 5. Updates and Modifications
Tanki Croco may be updated periodically to improve functionality or resolve problems. Users are advised to stay informed of any changes by checking our official communication channels.
